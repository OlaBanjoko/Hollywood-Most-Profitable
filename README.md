Welcome to my Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories Data Analysis project repository! This project showcases my data analysis skills using RStudio and Power BI to explore and visualize insights from the Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories dataset.

## Project Overview ✨
In this project, I utilized the Hollywood's Most Profitable Stories dataset to gain insights into various aspects of the film industry. I started by exploring and cleaning the data using RStudio, then exported the cleaned dataset for visualization in Power BI.

## Project Components 📋
1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration (RStudio)**
   - Explored the initial dataset to understand its structure and identify any data quality issues 🔍.
   - Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting inconsistencies 🧹.
   - Conducted further exploration to ensure the data was ready for analysis 📊.
   - Exported the cleaned dataset to a CSV file for use in Power BI 💾.

2. **Interactive Dashboard (Power BI)**
   - Imported the cleaned dataset into Power BI.
   - Developed a dashboard containing five interactive visuals to explore:
     - **Average Rotten Tomatoes Ratings of Each Genre**: A bar chart displaying the average critic ratings for each movie genre 🍅.
     - **Number of Movies Produced per Year**: A line chart showing the yearly trend in movie production 🎬.
     - **Audience Score for Each Film**: A scatter plot depicting audience scores for individual films 📈.
     - **Profitability per Studio**: A column chart illustrating the profitability of different movie studios 🏢.
     - **Worldwide Gross per Genre**: A pie chart showing the distribution of worldwide gross earnings across different genres 🌍.
   - Integrated interactive features such as filtering and drill-through for a dynamic user experience 🎯.

## How to Use 🛠️
